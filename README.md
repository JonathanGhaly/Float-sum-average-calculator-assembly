AT&T assembly program that can be compiled in the same way the blackboard samples are compiled.
The program should take the following inputs from the user:
* An integer n.
* n floating point numbers (Use the "double" type. Do not use "float" type.)
The program should output the sum and the average of the n input numbers.
